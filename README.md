# Door Unlocking Mechanism for the Mech E "Room of Requirment" at Tufts University 
## Developed by Daniel McGinn as part of a design project for ME 184: Advanced Robotics in Fall 2017. 

This project was part of a larger project to develop a “Marauder’s App,” a joint venture between Tufts School of Engineering and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

The LabVIEW code utilizes the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to recognize a password. If the correct password is spoken, a MyRio turns a high torque servo to open the door. It works like a charm!
